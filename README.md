# Classification-of-Remote-Sensing-Images
The goal of this group project is to develop and compare different computer vision methods for classifying aerial scenes from remote sensing images. Such a task has many real-world applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring and disaster response by enabling automated analysis of large-scale satellite and drone imagery.
