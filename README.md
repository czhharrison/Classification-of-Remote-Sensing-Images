# The dataset to be used in this group project is available from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankit1743/skyview-an-aerial-landscape-dataset).  It contains 15 landscape categories, with each category containing 800 high-quality images. It is thus a well-balanced dataset and the task is to develop and evaluate computer vision methods for classifying the images into 15 landscape categories.
